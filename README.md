Better Running Log
==================
### A simple command line tool that helps me keep track of how much I run.

The easiest things to use have only exactly what they need. For me, this is that kind of running log. If you've ever found that keeping track of your running involves too many input boxes and radio buttons, this might be for you too.

This is just the beginning of this project, hacked up in a few hours to keep track of the important stuff without my head freakin' *exploding*. 

Some things I want to add in the future (some *waaaaaay* in the future):
* Command Line interface with some simple commands
* What happens if I run twice a day??
* Cross training functionality
* Analysis of weeks, months maybe even whole YEARS
* Web app???....
* **Best log on the planet**
